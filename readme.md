### DESCRIPTION

We feel proud to announce that our team Quikee has secured the third prize of Zubi Let’s Hack 1.0

Allergies can be pinpointed with the help of a medical professionals easily, but it’s a hassle to find out if the dish contained any allergic ingredients, especially in the case of takeouts or ordering food online.

***Our solution***: AllerTgy aims to eliminate this hassle by telling you all the ingredients just by uploading a picture. Along with the food ingredients, we also provide the user with nutritional information about the food item.
